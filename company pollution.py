An industrial company has N factories each producing some pollution every month. The company decided to
reduce the fume emissions using one or more filters. Every such filter reduces the pollution by half. 
When the second(subsequent) filter is applied, it again reduces by half the remaining pollution 
emitted after fitting the existing filter(s).
